# House Sales in King County, USA

## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes house sales data in King County, USA (including Seattle) for homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The goal is to explore relationships between different house features and sale prices, perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to estimate house prices.
